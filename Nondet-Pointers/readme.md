# Nondet-Pointers

## Introduction

This is a live tutorial on how CBMC deals with nondeterministic pointers.
We're going to look at:

1. CBMC's memory model
2. Semantics of nondeterministic pointers?

All of the tools that we are demoing today have been built out of `develop`
at the time when `cbmc-5.88.0` was released.

## CBMC's memory model

## Semantics of nondeterministic pointers?
