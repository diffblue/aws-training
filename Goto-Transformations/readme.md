## Introduction

This is a live tutorial on transformations applied to the Goto program by
various tools in our suite of tools. We're going to look at:

1. Symex-Ready Goto Transformations,
2. (Optional) Transformations applied by `cbmc`, and
3. Transformations applied by `goto-instrument`.

All of the tools that we are demoing today have been built out of `develop`
at the time when `cbmc-5.88.0` was released.

## Symex-Ready Goto Transformations

These are transformations that need to be performed to bring a binary
to a `symex-ready` state - that is, get it into a form that can be
admitted by `symex` without any expected errors (invariants about the
structure of instructions and unlowered expressions as an example).

These transformations have a sequencing dependency, and they are presented
here in the order in which they are performed:

### Remove Assembly

> Implementation in `src/assembler/remove_asm.cpp`

This transformation detects code blocks containing `inline asm` and rewrites
the assembly instructions into `goto-instructions` that have the same semantics.

```c
// original
asm volatile (
  "mov %1, %0; add $1, %0"
  : "=r" (result)
  : "r" (input));

// transformed
ASSIGN main::1::result := main::1::input
ASSIGN main::1::result := main::1::result + 1
```

It's worth mentioning that the tool currently supports doing so for the `x86`
and `Power` architectures.

Unfortunately, I cannot demo this on my local machine, as it's a different
architecture, which means that initialisation for an `aarch64` configuration
means that the system knows that my local assembly flavour would be arm, and
skips the assembly instructions when analysed under this system.

Where you to try this out however, you would want to run something like the
following instruction:

```sh
$ cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/remove_asm.c
```

### Linking to standard libraries

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/link_to_library.cpp`

This transformation is looking for function calls inside the goto-program,
where the body of the function is missing and searches the CPROVER library
(under `src/ansi-c/library/`) for a function matching the signature and includes
it in the goto-model.

This usually shows up in the output when the step `Adding CPROVER library` is
done. An actual example would look like this:

```sh
$ cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/linking_cprover_lib.c
[...]
Adding CPROVER library (arm64)
file <builtin-library-fabs> line 2: warning: implicit function declaration "fabs"
old definition in module linking_cprover_lib file listings/linking_cprover_lib.c line 5 function main
signed int (void)
new definition in module <built-in-library> file <builtin-library-fabs> line 2
double (double d)
[...]
```

### Remove Function Pointers

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/remove_function_pointers.cpp`

This transformation detects function calls of a dereferenced pointer, and at
that point, it looks up all possible targets of the pointer dereference (it
does that by looking at the function pointer signature, and matching all the
functions with a similar syntax), and substitutes the original expression with
a jump table:

```c
// Original:
int (*fptr_t)(int) fptr;
// ...
assert(fptr(10) == 11);

// Transformed:
if (fptr == &f) f(10)
else if (fptr == &g) g(10)
else if (fptr == &o) o(10)
else assert(false);
```

Let's have a look at a live demo of this: [`remove_function_pointers.c`](listings/remove_function_pointers.c)

Let's examine the `goto-functions` produced by `cbmc`:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/remove_function_pointers.c | tail -26
[...]
```

This transformation is implemented in `src/goto-programs/remove_function_pointers.{c++, h}`
and it works in pretty much the expected way:

1. It goes through all functions/instructions of those functions.
2. If it finds a function call with a target being a dereference expression,
   it then dispatches into the handling function.
3. The handling function goes through all the functions in the model, and
   identifies the ones with similar types for the parameters and the return
   type, and then
4. Construct the `if (ptr == &f) goto 1 - 1: f(arg)` expressions and builds a new
   code block that forms a dispatch table.
5. Substitute the original instruction with the codeblock containing the dispatch
   table.

### Instrument preconditions

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/instrument_preconditions.cpp`

This transformation is moving function preconditions (which are in the form
of `__CPROVER_precondition`s in the first few instructions of the function body)
before call sites of the functions that are instrumented.

Let's have a look:

```c
#include <assert.h>

int div(int a, int b)
{
    __CPROVER_precondition(b != 0, "Can't divide by zero");
    __CPROVER_precondition(a != 0, "Dividend expected to not be zero");
    return a / b;
}

int main()
{
    int a;
    int b;
    assert(div(a, b) != 0);
}
```

```sh
$ cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/instrument_precond.c | tail -39
[...]
```

The way this works is by going through all the function calls in the goto-program,
finding whether the particular function at that call site has any preconditions, and
if it does, it inserts the preconditions before the call-site.

After it has done so for every function, the it iterates through the function map
again, finding any functions containing preconditions, and removing them.

### Remove Returns

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/remove_returns.cpp`

This transformation eliminates return statements from the program, and in their
place it substitutes for reads/writes to global variables. The transformation
looks like this:

```c
// original
int foo()
{
   return 1;
}

r = foo();

// transformed (symbolically, the signature of the function isn't really changed)
int foo_return;
void foo()
{
   foo_return = 1;
}

foo();
r = foo_return;
```

To see it in GOTO, let's try the following:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/remove_return.c | tail -33
foo /* foo */
        // 17 file listings/remove_return.c line 3 function foo
        SET RETURN VALUE (foo::b = 2 ? 4 : 8)
        // 18 file listings/remove_return.c line 4 function foo
        END_FUNCTION

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

main /* main */
        DECL main::$tmp::return_value_foo : signedbv[32]
        CALL main::$tmp::return_value_foo := foo(main::1::nondet)
        ASSIGN main::1::res := main::$tmp::return_value_foo
        ASSERT main::1::res ≠ 4 // expected false, path exists for res == 4
        //...
```

This operation also has a dual in the form of `restore_returns()`

### Remove/Lower Vector Typed Expressions

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/remove_vector.cpp`

This pass removes types that represent vectors created by compiler intrinsics
for AVX, SSE and MMX instruction set extensions. It does so by translating corresponding
vector operations into array operations:

```
// original
vector x;
vector y;
vector z = x + y;

// transformed
array x[32];
array y[32];
array z[32] = [x[0] + y[0], x[1] + y[1], x[2] + y[2], ...]
```

As an example, consider the file [`remove_vector.c`](listings/remove_vector.c).

We're going to ask CBMC to show us the goto-functions for this particular example:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/remove_vector.c
[...]
DECL main::1::a : signedbv[32][4]
ASSIGN main::1::a := { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
DECL main::1::b : signedbv[32][4]
ASSIGN main::1::b := { 5, 6, 7, 8 }
DECL main::1::c : signedbv[32][4]
ASSIGN main::1::c := { main::1::a[0] + main::1::b[0], main::1::a[1] + main::1::b[1], main::1::a[2] + main::1::b[2], main::1::a[3] + main::1::b[3] }
```

### Remove/Lower Complex Typed Expression

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/remove_complex.cpp`

Removes complex numbers by turning them into struct types.

As an example, consider:

```c
#include <assert.h>

int main()
{
  // C99 Complex number
  _Complex c;
  c=1.0i+2;

  assert(__real__ c == 2);
  assert(__imag__ c == 1);
}
```

which is turned into

```sh
$ cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/complex.c | tail -17
[...]
DECL main::1::c : struct { floatbv[64] real, floatbv[64] imag }
ASSIGN main::1::c := { ... 1.0, ... 2 }
ASSERT ... ieee_float_equal(main::1::c.real, ...
ASSERT ... ieee_float_equal(main::1::c.imag, ...
```

### Rewrite Unions

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/rewrite_union.cpp`

This transformation rewrites union member reads as `byte_extract` expressions
and union member writes as `byte_update` expressions. So for code like:

```c
typedef union uni {
    int a;
    int b;
} uni;

int main() {
    uni u = {.a = 3, .b = 4 };
    u.a = 5;
    __CPROVER_assert(u.a != 4, "expected failure, a is 5");
}
```

We get:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/rewriting_union.c
[...]
        DECL main::1::u : union tag-uni
        ASSIGN main::1::u := byte_update_little_endian(side_effect statement="nondet" is_nondet_nullable="1", 0, 4, union tag-uni)
        ASSIGN byte_extract_little_endian(main::1::u, 0, signedbv[32]) := 5
        ASSERT byte_extract_little_endian(main::1::u, 0, signedbv[32]) ≠ 4 // expected failure, a is 5
[...]
```

The reason for this transformation is to facilitate presenting a unified interface
to symex (with `byte_update`).

### goto_check_c

> Implementation in `src/ansi-c/goto_check_c.cpp`

This is actually a series of transformations relating to C style language semantics.
A lot of the instrumentations added by a flag are introduced at this point, after
checking if the flag has been set up appropriately (`bounds-check`, `enum-range-check`,
`pointer-checks`, `integer-overflow-checks`, etc).

Let's have a look at an instrumentation added this way:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/div_zero.c > no_instr.goto.txt
$ binaries/cbmc --div-by-zero-check --show-goto-functions listings/div_zero.c > instr.goto.txt
$ diff no_instr.goto.txt instr.goto.txt
42a43,44
>         ASSERT ¬(*div::b = 0) // division by zero in *a / *b
>         // 17 file listings/div_zero.c line 3 function div
44c46
<         // 17 file listings/div_zero.c line 4 function div
---
>         // 18 file listings/div_zero.c line 4 function div
$ rm no_instr.goto.txt instr.goto.txt
```

### Adjust Float Expressions

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/adjust_float_expressions.cpp`

This transforms operations applied to floating-point values in the program into
floating-point-specific operations (`ID_plus` -> `float_bv_plus`), which are
carrying more information, such as the rounding mode, which affects the evaluation
of these operations as applied to floating point operands. As an example, C code
like the following:

```c
int main()
{
    float a = 3.10f;
    float b = 2.09f;
    float c = a + b;
    __CPROVER_assert(c != 3.19f, "may fail");
}
```

Would have the `+` operator between the two float operands transformed into:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --show-goto-functions listings/float_demo.c | tail -27
[...]
ASSIGN main::1::c := floatbv_plus(main::1::a, main::1::b, __CPROVER_rounding_mode)
[...]
```

### Goto Functions Update

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/goto_functions.cpp`

This transformation re-adjusts missing/invalidated fields on `goto-functions`
that need to be changed as a result of previous transformations.

This re-adjusts incoming edges for all instructions, target counts (the instruction
target-index for the targets table of another instruction), location numbers (the
global numeric identifier for an instruction in the program) and loop counts
(a numeric identifier for each loop).

Isn't amenable to easy demoing without trying to bring CBMC into a semi-crippled
basis, so we're going to skip a demo for this one.

### Add Failed Symbols

> Implementation in `src/pointer-analysis/add_failed_symbol.cpp`

A failed symbol is a pointer dereference at an lvalue position, for which we do
not have adequate information to determine who the pointee is. We use failed symbols
so that we nondet the result of the dereference instead of the whole memory in that
case.

Doesn't lend itself to easy demoing, as we can't demonstrate failed symbols in a user
friendly manner, as this information is attached to the type of the symbol, for
which we can't more information about outside of what's available when we print
the symbol table.

I have however, isolated some debug output from a custom build of CBMC to show
us what symbols are added as failed for the following program:

```c
int main()
{
  int *p, *q, *a, *b;

  q = a;
  p = b;

  *p = 1;
  *q = 2;

  // this should work if no pointer checks are enabled
  assert(*p == 1);
  assert(*q == 2);
}
```

for which we get:

```
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol main::1::b$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol main::1::a$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol main::1::q$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol main::1::p$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol __CPROVER_architecture_os$object   // const char * = "macos"
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol __CPROVER_architecture_arch$object // const char * = "arm64"
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol __CPROVER_dead_object$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol __CPROVER_deallocated$object
[DEBUG] Adding failed symbol __CPROVER_memory_leak$object
```

### Remove Skip Instructions

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/remove_skip.cpp`

This transformation is removing `SKIP` instructions at the GOTO level. These are
usually the outcome of some other transformations eliminating some instructions.

Symex doesn't handle `SKIP` instructions, aside from treating them as `LOCATION`
instructions, which are instructions semantically equivalent to `SKIP`s, but preserved
after various transformations in the program text.

### Label Properties

> Implementation in `src/goto-programs/set_properties.cpp`

This transformation is responsible operates only on `ASSERT` instructions,
and is responsible for setting up the identifiers of the various assertions
in the program.

It does so by fixing a name for the assertion by first prefixing the enclosing
function's name, then the property's class, and then attaching the current value
of a counter for them.

As an example:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --bounds-check listings/demo_prop_names.c
CBMC version 5.88.0 (cbmc-5.88.0) 64-bit arm64 macos
Parsing /tmp/demo_prop_names.c
[...]

** Results:
/tmp/weird30.c function main
[main.array_bounds.1] line 7 array 'A' lower bound in A[(signed long int)nondet]: SUCCESS
[main.array_bounds.2] line 7 array 'A' upper bound in A[(signed long int)nondet]: SUCCESS
[main.assertion.1] line 8 expected false: FAILURE
[main.assertion.2] line 9 expected false: FAILURE

** 2 of 4 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
```

## Goto-Instrument Transformations

All of the above tranformations are done by `CBMC` to bring the binary
to what we call [`symex-ready-goto`](https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc/adr/symex-ready-goto.html)
form. This is the form that symex operates on, and the transformations
above are *required* before any analysis, in the sense that they lower
language features that if still present by the time the binary meets symex,
analysis will not proceed, failing instead with an invariant violation.

All of the aforementioned transformations were also done automatically,
with the user not needing to know about them to use CBMC.

But there are many more transformations that one can perform on a goto-binary
before it's sent to analysis, and these are all added to the tool `goto-instrument`.
The workflow in that case would be:

```
goto-cc file.c -o file.goto
goto-instrument --<transform_opt> file.goto file.instrumented.goto
cbmc file.instrumented.goto
```

There are a lot of potential transformations that can happen in this manner,
so in the interest of time, let's just visit a few as a representative sample
of them and see what they do and how they work.

### `--nondet-static`

In the C standard, `6.7.8` suggests that static members are default initialised
to a `0` value.

But what happens if you would rather assume `nondet` values for those instead?
(Say, because you might be analysing a program that runs in a non-standard
embedded platform where the compiler might be not conforming to the above
specification).

This is where the `--nondet-static flag` comes in. Assume the following file:

```c
static int counter;

int main()
{
    __CPROVER_assert(counter == 0, "expected false, static init == 0");
}
```

CBMC on its own would give us the following result:

```sh
$ cbmc listings/nondet_static.c
[...]
** Results:
listings/nondet_static.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 5 expected false, static init == 0: SUCCESS

** 0 of 1 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

But what happens if we instrument the program?

```sh
$ binaries/goto-cc -o nondet_static.goto listings/nondet_static.c

$ binaries/goto-instrument --nondet-static nondet_static.goto nondet_static.instr.goto
goto-instrument --nondet-static nondet_static.goto nondet_static.instr.goto
Reading GOTO program from 'nondet_static.goto'
Adding nondeterministic initialization of static/global variables
Writing GOTO program to 'nondet_static.instr.goto'

$ binaries/cbmc nondet_static.instr.goto
[...]
** Results:
listings/nondet_static.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 5 expected false, static init == 0: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED

$ binaries/goto-inspect --show-goto-functions nondet_static.goto
[...]
__CPROVER_initialize /* __CPROVER_initialize */
      // 14 file listings/nondet_static.c line 1
      ASSIGN counter := 0

$ binaries/goto-inspect --show-goto-functions nondet_static.instr.goto
__CPROVER_initialize /* __CPROVER_initialize */
      // 9 file listings/nondet_static.c line 1
      ASSIGN counter := side_effect statement="nondet" is_nondet_nullable="1"

$ rm nondet_static.goto nondet_static.instr.goto
```

### `--malloc-may-fail`

By default, CBMC's `malloc` model will not fail. This is in contrast to
allocations on an actual system, where `malloc` can fail. So how do we
bridge this discrepancy if we want to model a system more realistically?

`goto-instrument` and `cbmc` have a series of flags that enable modelling
`malloc` potentially failing, along with the behaviour of failure mode.

Let's have a look:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int *a = malloc(sizeof(int));
    __CPROVER_assert(a != NULL, "can fail");
    *a = 5;
    __CPROVER_assert(*a == 5, "expected a to be 5");
}

```

By default, `cbmc` would be pretty sure that this assertion can't be
violated:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc listings/malloc_fail.c
[...]
** Results:
<builtin-library-malloc> function malloc
[malloc.assertion.1] line 31 max allocation size exceeded: SUCCESS
[malloc.assertion.2] line 36 max allocation may fail: SUCCESS

listings/malloc_fail.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 6 can fail: SUCCESS
[main.assertion.2] line 8 expected a to be 5: SUCCESS

** 0 of 4 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

What happens if we instrument a program with intrinsics that hint that
malloc can fail instead?

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc --malloc-may-fail --malloc-fail-null listings/malloc_fail.c
[...]
** Results:
<builtin-library-malloc> function malloc
[malloc.assertion.1] line 31 max allocation size exceeded: SUCCESS
[malloc.assertion.2] line 36 max allocation may fail: SUCCESS

listings/malloc_fail.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 6 can fail: FAILURE
[main.assertion.2] line 8 expected a to be 5: SUCCESS

** 1 of 4 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
```

### `--generate-function-body`

`goto-instrument` has the capability to produce a function body for
a given function to assist with modelling, with the behaviour allowable
being nondeterministically returning a value, asserting false, assuming
false, and havocing a parameter.

Assume that we're given the following code:

```c
int forbidden(int x);

int main() {
    int x = 4;
    int y = forbidden(y);

    __CPROVER_assert(y != 5, "should never be 5");
}
```

A normal CBMC run with this file would produce a warning:

```sh
$ binaries/cmbc listings/generate_function_body.c
CBMC version 5.88.0 (cbmc-5.88.0) 64-bit arm64 macos
Reading GOTO program from file funcbody.goto
Generating GOTO Program

Removal of function pointers and virtual functions
Generic Property Instrumentation
Running with 8 object bits, 56 offset bits (default)
Starting Bounded Model Checking
**** WARNING: no body for function addone
[...]
```

Let's see how we could go about changing that:

```sh
$ binaries/goto-cc -o funcbody.goto listings/generate_function_body.c

$ binaries/goto-inspect --show-goto-functions funcbody.goto
<confirms no body for forbidden>
```

Let's instrument this file to ask for a body for forbiddent to be
generated:

```sh
$ binaries/goto-instrument --generate-function-body forbidden funcbody.goto funcbody.instr.goto

$ binaries/goto-inspect --show-goto-functions funcbody.instr.goto
[...]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

forbidden /* forbidden */
        // 12 file listings/generate_function_body.c line 1 function forbidden
        DECL forbidden::return_value : signedbv[32]
        // 13 file listings/generate_function_body.c line 1 function forbidden
        ASSIGN forbidden::return_value := side_effect statement="nondet" is_nondet_nullable="1"
        // 14 file listings/generate_function_body.c line 1 function forbidden
        SET RETURN VALUE forbidden::return_value
        // 15 file listings/generate_function_body.c line 1 function forbidden
        DEAD forbidden::return_value
        // 16 file listings/generate_function_body.c line 1 function forbidden
        END_FUNCTION
[...]
```

Let's have a look at how analysis results have changed for this file:

```sh
$ binaries/cbmc funcbody.instr.goto
[...]
** Results:
listings/generate_function_body.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 7 should never be 5: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
```

Let's now see what happens if we change the function body generator's
behaviour, and ask instead for an `assume(false)` to be in the function's
generated body:

```sh
$ binaries/goto-instrument --generate-function-body forbidden --generate-function-body-options assume-false funcbody.goto funcbody.instr.goto

$ binaries/cbmc funcbody.instr.goto
[...]
** Results:
listings/generate_function_body.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 7 should never be 5: SUCCESS

** 0 of 1 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

We now see that the `assume(false)` has wreaked havoc on our search space,
causing the assertions that follow that code point to be vacuously true.

Let's see how analysis changes for a different behaviour:

```sh
$ binaries/goto-instrument --generate-function-body forbidden --generate-function-body-options assert-false funcbody.goto funcbody.instr.goto

$ binaries/cbmc funcbody.instr.goto
** Results:
listings/generate_function_body.c function forbidden
[forbidden.assertion.1] line 1 undefined function should be unreachable: FAILURE

listings/generate_function_body.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 7 should never be 5: FAILURE

** 2 of 2 failed (3 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
```
